      <h2>We Game to Experience New Worlds, Both Old and New.</h2>
      <p>When we were young we couldnt wait to come home after school and play the hottest
        new games. If they were multiplayer it was an excuse to have a sleep over with 
         all your friends. Back then internet wasnt as big as it is now so we had lan parties
         and stayed up all night eatting junk food and pranking the first one to fall asleep.
         Now we have it pretty easy install steam and play games with all your friends when ever 
         you want. Most of the people you meet dont even live near you so it doesnt even matter
         where you are in the world. </p>

          <h2>GTA:V</h2>
          <p>Now this game has been around for a long time however the devs at rockstar keep adding new content.
            The Cayo Perico Heist update is described by Rockstar Games as “the largest and most ambitious Grand
             Theft Auto Online adventure to date.” Players will find a brand new island and compound to rob,
              owned by the insanely wealthy drug cartel leader El Rubio.
            You meet a new contact, Miguel Madrazo, son of Martin Madrazo from the main story, who needs a 
            professional to steal some sensitive files from El Rubio on his island. Any other drugs, cash, 
            or valuables you find during the mission are yours to sell.
            To set up the heist, players must purchase a decommissioned Soviet military submarine, piloted by 
            the best character I’ve seen in a long time, Pavel. Buying the base level of the submarine will 
            set you back $2.2 million, but I recommend purchasing the Sparrow helicopter add-on ($1.815 million) 
            for quick travel to and from mission points. </p>

          <h2>Cyberpunk 2077</h2>
          <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is an engaging experience unlike anything else. The open world mechanics are top notch
             and there is almost always something to do on the map. Furthermore, we have a large number of different
              game paths to choose from, all of which give you a very own experience of the story. Combined with
               the hundreds of weapons, augmentations, upgrades and side missions, there is plenty of material that
                will last over a long period of time. Cyberpunk 2077 will definitely be remembered as one of the most
                 significant titles in the history of gaming media.</p>
